# Pegasus Workflow Execution Instances

This directory contains workflow execution instances generated from
[Pegasus](http://pegasus.isi.edu) workflow executions. The instances
hosted in this directory use the
[WfCommons JSON format](https://github.com/wfcommons/workflow-schema)
for describing workflow executions.

#### Repository Structure

Workflow execution instances are organized into sub-directories within this
directory. Each sub-directory represents a _workflow application_, which
itself contains sub-directories for workflow executions in different
_computing platforms_.

#### Workflow Simulator

The execution instances provided in this directory are compatible with any
[simulator framework](https://wfcommons.org/simulation) that implements
the [WfCommons JSON format](https://github.com/wfcommons/workflow-schema).
