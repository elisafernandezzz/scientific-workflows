# Sample "hello world!" Workflow Execution Instances

This directory contains made up workflow execution instances for testing
purposes, described using the [WfCommons JSON format](https://github.com/wfcommons/workflow-schema). These have been constructed based on real-world executions of purely synthetic benchmark workflows on using [Pegasus](http://pegasus.isi.edu).

#### Workflow Instances

There are two workflow instances: 
  - `chain-5-chameleon.json`: a linear workflow with 5 tasks.
  - `forkjoin-10-chameleon.json`: a fork-join workflow with 18 tasks.

#### Workflow Simulator

The execution instances provided in this directory are compatible with any
[simulator framework](https://wfcommons.org/simulation) that implements
the [WfCommons JSON format](https://github.com/wfcommons/workflow-schema).
